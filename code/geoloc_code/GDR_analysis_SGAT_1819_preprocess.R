  # Two windows will appear. Move them so they are not on top of each other and you can see
  # both. They should look like a big black blob. This identifies the "nightime" period over
  # time. The top of the blob shows all the sunrises and the bottom of blob shows all the 
  # sunsets. You can note for instance that the days get longer (and thus the nights shorter)
  # at the end of the time series, because the blob gets thinner. You may even note changes
  # in the light image that relate to changes in activity patterns or breeding behavior.
  
  # Step 1. Click on the window entitled "Select subset". With the left mouse button choose
  # where you want the start of the dataset to be, and right mouse button to choose the end.
  # You will notice that the red bar at the top moves and that the second window zooms into
  # that time period. Select when you want your time series to start and end. This allows
  # you to ignore for instance periods of nesting. Once you are happy with the start and 
  # end of the timeseries press "a" on the keyboard to accept and move to next step.
  
  # Step 2. click on the window entitled "Find twilights" and the second window will zoom in.
  # All you need to do here is click in the dark part (in the zoomed in image i.e. the one not
  # entitled "Find twilights") of the image and this will identify all the sunrises (orange)
  # and sunsets (blue) based on the threshold defined in the previous section. Press "a" on 
  # the keyboard to accept and move to next step.
  
  # Step 3. This step is for adding or deleting points. If there are no missing data points,
  # you can skip this step by pressing "a" on the keyboard. However, if you do want to add a
  # point, you can click on the "Insert twilights" window to select a region of "the blob" that
  # the second unintitled window will zoom into. In the zoomed window, use left mouse click to
  # add a sunrise, and right mouse click to add a sunset. You can use "u" on the keyboard to 
  # undo any changes, and "d" to delete any points which are extra. Press "a" to move to next 
  # step.
  
  # Step 4. This step allows you to find points which have been miss-classified (often because
  # the bird was in the shade or in a burrow) and to move the respective sunrise or sunset to
  # where it should be. Choose a point by clicking on it in the "edit twilights" window and the
  # other window will display the sunrise (or sunset) from the previous and next days (purple
  # and green) relative to the current sunrise or sunset (in black). Thus if the black line 
  # shows a much earlier sunset or later sunrise than the purple and green ones, it is likely 
  # badly classified. You can then left click at the point where you want the day to start and
  # press "a" to accept and move the sunrise or sunset. You will notice the red line then moves.
  # Do this for as many points as necessary. Then close the windows with "q".
